# US-Projekat-Blackjack
<p align="justify">US-Projekat-Blackjack is a program, specifically, a game demo made as a part of the Embedded Systems course. It was written in C++ and made for use and testing in mbed simulator. The game is supposed to be a simplified version of the traditional casino banking game Blackjack.</p>

## Testing 
Anybody interested in playing around with the demo or testing it can do so by visiting https://labs.mbed.com/simulator (until December 2022). If you're reading this after December 2022, you can set up this simulator on your local machine by following the appropriate guide in the readme section https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-simulator#readme. In order for the code to work you need to add an LCD display component `ST7789H2 LCD + FT6x06 Touch Screen`. After doing so, you can copy the code found in Blackjack.cpp and run the demo.
